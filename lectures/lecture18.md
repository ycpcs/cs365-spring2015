# Using CUDA Threads

To fully exploit GPU hardware using CUDA, it is necessary to use CUDA threads.

The good news is that CUDA threads are not like CPU threads (e.g., pthreads or Java threads).  Threads appear in the CUDA programming model as an additional index or indices, similar to the block index/indices, that your kernel function will use to determine its assignment in the overall computation.

The basic idea is very simple: in specifying the parallel blocks to be executed, either as an integer or as multiple dimensions, you can also specify the number of threads per block.  The number of threads can be specified as an integer, or as multiple dimensions (using the `dim3` data type, in the same way that multiple dimensions can be specified for parallel blocks.)

## Example: Mandelbrot set

In our [original CUDA example code](cudaHello.zip), we used one thread per parallel block.  In the revised example code ([cudaHello2.zip](cudaHello2.zip)), we define a constant (`THREADS_PER_BLOCK`) to specify a fixed number of threads per block.  The number of threads per block should be a multiple of 32 in order to use hardware resources efficiently.

Because each block will now execute the kernel function using multiple threads, we reduce the number of rows of parallel blocks:

{% highlight cpp %}
int num_blocks_y = DIM / THREADS_PER_BLOCK; // determine how many rows per block
if (DIM % THREADS_PER_BLOCK > 0) {
	// Number of rows did not divide evenly by number of threads:
	// add one additional block.  The kernel function will
	// check to make sure that the block index and the thread
	// index yield a valid row.
	num_blocks_y++;
}
dim3 grid(DIM, num_blocks_y);
kernel<<<grid, THREADS_PER_BLOCK>>>( dev_data );
{% endhighlight %}

Note that because the problem size (in one or more dimensions) might not divide evenly by the number of threads, it may be necessary to schedule additional blocks.
